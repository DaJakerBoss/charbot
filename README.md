a basic bot for my discord servers because I wanted to learn to make one!

so far charbot can:
    count uwus!
        charbot will count every instance of 'uwu' she sees in incoming messages. This will get added to a running total per person stored in a persistent neDB database file in her root directory. A global uwu count is available but is not stored persistently, thats coming next!

    configure herself!
        charbot let's you set which character or set of characters you want to use to call her commands, straight from within discord. Just run the 'config' command to see all the available config items to be set.
